In this project, we present a semi-supervised approach to detect credit card fraud in real time. And 
implemented a whole data pipeline and data visualization dashboard to monitor transactions and 
fraud alerts, as well as the model performance.

## Requirements:
- Kafaka Server <br>
  You can use docker images for Kafka and Zookeeper from DockerHub <br>
  we used wurstmeister/kafka, wurstmeister/zookeeper
- PostgreSQL Database <br>
  Use the official PostgreSQL Docker image or use the Azure PostgreSQL service
- Data visualization tool (ex. Grafana, Tableau, Power BI)
